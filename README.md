# AI Agents Modular Project

## Project Overview

This project provides a modular AI agent designed for **cryptocurrency analysis and report generation**. The agent:

- **Collects data** from multiple trading platforms.
- **Analyzes** key market metrics.
- **Generates detailed reports** to help traders make informed decisions while minimizing risks.

## Features

- **Multi-platform Data Collection**: Interfaces with APIs from major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Utilizes machine learning models to analyze trends, volume, and price movements in real-time.
- **Customizable Reports**: Offers configurable report formats tailored to user preferences or specific analytical needs.
- **Modular Architecture**: Allows for easy integration of new modules or updates to existing ones without affecting the core system.

## Architecture

- **Data Ingestion Module**: Responsible for fetching and storing data from various sources.
- **Analysis Engine**: Uses AI to process data and predict market movements.
- **Reporting Module**: Generates and formats reports based on analysis results.
