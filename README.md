## Project Overview

The AI Agents Modular project is a robust, modular AI system designed for cryptocurrency analysis and comprehensive report generation. This agent:
- Collects and processes data from multiple cryptocurrency trading platforms.
- Analyzes key market indicators using machine learning algorithms.
- Produces detailed, customizable reports to support informed trading decisions and mitigate risks.

## Features
- **Multi-platform Data Collection:** Seamlessly integrates with APIs from major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Applies AI models for live analysis of market trends, volume fluctuations, and price movements.
- **Configurable Reports:** Generates tailored reports based on user-defined parameters and analytical needs.
- **Modular Architecture:** Supports plug-and-play modules, facilitating easy integration and updates without disrupting the core system.

## Architecture
- **Data Fetcher Module:** Fetches and manages data from various external sources.
- **Metrics Analyzer Engine:** Employs AI for data processing, market predictions, and risk assessments.
- **Report Generator Module:** Creates and formats comprehensive analytical reports.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agents-modular.git
